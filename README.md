# Group name: Fitness Guys
Repo for demo idea and code for ICT720 course 2025.

## A health-tracking application
This is a health monitoring application that tracks the status of gym trainers in real time. The system utilizes heart rate and motion sensors (IMU) to detect abnormal changes in trainers' physical health during workouts. The application advises trainers on modifying their training or taking a rest. In case of an accident, it functions as an SOS application, sending an SOS signal for help.

# Project Build and Installation Guide

This document outlines the steps required to build and install the project. Please follow these instructions carefully to ensure a successful setup.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

* **Python 3.x:** This project is developed using Python. Verify your Python installation by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal.
* **MongoDB:** Ensure MongoDB is installed and running, as the project relies on it for data storage.
* **MQTT Broker:** An MQTT broker is required for real-time communication.
* **Git:** Git is necessary for cloning the repository.
* **Docker (Optional):** If Docker is used for containerization, ensure it is installed.

## Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    Use Git to clone the project repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

    Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your repository and `<project_directory>` with the directory name.

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env` file by copying the provided `.env-example` file.

    ```bash
    cp .env-example .env
    ```

    Open the `.env` file using a text editor and fill in the required environment variables.

    ```
    PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1  # Recommended for immediate output in logs

    # MongoDB Configuration
    MONGO_DB=<your_mongo_db_name>
    MONGO_COL_DEV=<your_mongo_dev_collection>
    MONGO_COL_USER=<your_mongo_user_collection>
    MONGO_USERNAME=<your_mongo_username>
    MONGO_PASSWORD=<your_mongo_password>
    MONGO_URI=<your_mongo_uri> # Example: mongodb://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<db>

    # REST API Endpoints
    REST_USER_URI=<your_user_api_endpoint>
    REST_ASSET_URI=<your_asset_api_endpoint>
    REST_STATION_URI=<your_station_api_endpoint> #If used
    

    # MQTT Configuration
    MQTT_BROKER=<your_mqtt_broker_address>
    MQTT_PORT=<your_mqtt_broker_port>
    MQTT_TOPIC=<your_mqtt_topic>

    # LINE Messaging API Configuration
    LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET=<your_line_channel_secret>
    LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your_line_channel_access_token>
    LINE_USER_ID=<your_line_user_id>
    LIFF_ID=<your_liff_id>
    LINE_URL=<your_line_url>

    # Additional API Configurations
    API_URL=<your_api_url>
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your_google_api_key>
    ```

    **Important:** Ensure you replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration details. Securely manage your `.env` file and avoid committing it to version control.

3.  **Install Dependencies (Using pip):**

    If your project uses Python dependencies, install them using `pip`.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    If a `requirements.txt` file is not provided, install the necessary packages manually.

4.  **Build the Project (If Necessary):**

    If your project requires a build step (e.g., compiling code, building Docker images), execute the relevant build commands.

    * **Docker Build Example:**

        ```bash
        docker build -t <your_image_name> .
        ```

    * **Python Build (If applicable):**

        If the project contains setup.py run:

        ```bash
        python setup.py install
        ```

5.  **Run the Project:**

    Execute the project using the appropriate commands.

    * **Python Execution Example:**

        ```bash
        python main.py
        ```

    * **Docker Run Example:**

        ```bash
        docker run -p <host_port>:<container_port> <your_image_name>
        ```

    Adjust the commands based on your project's specific requirements.

6.  **Upload/Deployment (If Applicable):**

    If you need to deploy the project to a server or cloud platform, follow the appropriate deployment procedures.

    * **Example: Uploading via SCP:**

        ```bash
        scp -r <project_directory> <user>@<server_address>:<remote_directory>
        ```

    * **Deployment to a Cloud Platform:**

        Follow the cloud platform's documentation for deployment instructions.

## Troubleshooting

* If you encounter dependency issues, ensure you have the correct Python version and that your `pip` is up to date.
* Verify that your environment variables are correctly set in the `.env` file.
* Check the project's logs for error messages.
* Consult the project's documentation or contact the project maintainers for further assistance.


** Make sure to configure your `.env` file with the correct values before running the application.
## How to use the data
1) **Name**
2) **Age**
3) **BMI** ->> four catagories : 
-**Underweight** = < 18.5
-**Normal weight** = 18.5 - 24.9
-**Overweight** = 25-29.9
-**Obesity** = BMI of 30 or greater
	 
4) **Recommended Workout plan**

| BMI Category    | BMI Range       | Workout Focus |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Underweight** | < 18.5          | Building muscle mass and strength. |
| **Normal Weight** | 18.5 - 24.9   | Maintaining fitness, improving cardiovascular health, and building strength. |
| **Overweight** | 25 - 29.9        | Losing weight, improving cardiovascular health, and building strength. |
| **Obesity** | â‰¥ 30             | Gradual weight loss, improving cardiovascular health, and increasing mobility. |
